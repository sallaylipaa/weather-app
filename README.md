# weather-app
A simple weather app for Android that shows current weather and 12 hour forecast in user location. The app uses phone GPS for location (city). The data is queried from Finnish Meteorological Institute open data service. Temperature and weather type are shown in the app.
The app has three classes. The MainActivity class controls the UI, checks for permissions, calls GPS API for location, and stores the data.
GeocodeCity takes the location as coordinates and reverse geocodes it to city. This is done in a separate thread. Once finished, it calls the third class, FetchFMIData that opens a connection to FMI data service, makes a query for forecast, and reads the sent XML file. Temperature and weather symbol are stored. This runs as a background task. The UI is then populated with the stored weather data.
